Lab Assignment 1 for DS6600 Fall 2025 at UVA

I chose the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE because it meets the requirement of  allowing other people to use the code in the repository for both commercial and non-commercial use, as denoted with the commercial use and private use checked under permissions in the choose a license website. It also prevents a more restrictive license under the "same license" condition that means that modifications of this code must be released under this same license. More information can be found here: https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/ 

If I had not supplied a license, github would have assumed the most restrictive license option where others have no rights to use my software and I hold the copywrite.

## .gitignore Configuration

The following section from the .gitignore file ensures that files such as .env (which hold sensitive information like API keys) will not be pushed to GitHub:

```
# Environments
.env
.envrc
.venv
env/
venv/
ENV/
env.bak/
venv.bak/

```
